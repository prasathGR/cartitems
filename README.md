# React + Vite

The "Add to Cart" project demonstrates a fundamental feature of e-commerce applicationsâ€”managing product selection and displaying their prices. Built with React.js, this project allows users to:

*Add products to their cart.

*View selected products in the cart.

*Check the total price of the selected items.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the basics of state management and dynamic user interactions in React.
